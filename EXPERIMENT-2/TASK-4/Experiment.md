# Experiment 2 - Task 4

Name: ADITYA

UID: 25BCS80034

## Aim

To find the fruits present in the fruit table but not present in the inventory table using EXCEPT.

## Question

Consider the same supermarket database used in the previous problem.

Write a query to output the name of the fruits (f_name) from the table 'fruit' which are not present in the table inventory.

The f_name column has the name of the fruits and inv_name has the name of the items in inventory.

## SQL Queries Used

### Find Fruits Not Present in Inventory

```sql
/* Write a query to output the name of the fruits (f_name) from the table 'fruit' which are not present in the table inventory(f_name column has the name of the fruits and inv_name has the name of the items in inventory). */

SELECT f_name FROM fruit
EXCEPT
SELECT inv_name FROM inventory;
```

## Output

```text
┌────────┐
│ f_name │
├────────┤
│ Apple  │
│ Mango  │
│ Orange │
└────────┘
```

## Output Screenshot
